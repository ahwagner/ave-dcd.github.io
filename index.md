# AVE Data Coordination, Dissemination and Standards (DCDS) Workstream

The [Atlas of Variant Effects (AVE) Alliance](https://www.varianteffect.org) aims to propel systematic and extensive measurement and analysis of the impact of genetic variants on functional elements of human, model organism and pathogen genomes, to further the understanding of genes, gene products and their regulation and empower the diagnosis and treatment of human disease.

The Data Coordination, Dissemination and Standards (DCDS) workstream facilitates the registration of MAVE projects and dissemination of MAVE data, primarily by overseeing the growth and management of a MAVE database. This group is responsible for federating this database with other resources identified by data consumers (e.g. ClinGen, UniProt, PharmGKB). Members of this group:

* Develop minimal information standards and data formats for MAVE datasets
* Engage with clinical and non-clinical data resources to enable MAVE data sharing
* Curate/organize MAVE data from literature into MaveDB and other resources
* Define and promote infrastructure for data deposition, coordination and dissemination

All members are expected to follow the [AVE Code of Conduct](https://www.varianteffect.org/code-of-conduct).
